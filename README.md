# Shopify's Frontend Coding Challenge 


Front-end was completed in React.js. I acknoweldge that I used 3rd party API to help me to complete this coding challenge. I used NASA's API and I had used Bootstrap for front end development and also used FontAwesome for icons.

## Some additional features I added were:
- Added a like button (though it doesn't animate when you click it :( 
- Added a loading state.
- Added a date picker which displays APOD from the date chosen up to the current date
-

## Limitations
- Clean up the UI. The date picker isn't so clean
- Refactor code to Redux
- When a date after the current date is selected then nothing is selected. Should have added error checking for this.
